## Research-Project-on-Fertility-Rate

Hello,

I am a graduate student and a full-time Research Assistant at the Departmnet of Econmonics at Hong Kong Baptist Uiveristy. I am inspired to study topics related to fertility rate during my master's program. Many developed economies are having underpopluation problem and a low fertility rate causes some very throny social issues to the economies. Fertility is a very complicated subject.

I independently completed two thesis topic related to fertility rate in Hong Kong

### Financial Incentives



### Housing Prices

A by-product of studying the effect of Financial Incentives on fertility rate in the long run.
